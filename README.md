A small program designed to pull a random image from alpha.wallhaven.cc and set it as the desktop background. Setting a wallpaper in java is alot more difficult than anticipated so will look at later.

If the oppurtunity arises I intend to port this over to ionic so wallhevn pictures can be used on mobiles easily.
